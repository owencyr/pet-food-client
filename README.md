## Summary

Pet food shopping is hard, the process of searching for foods that
have the right ingredients and none of the wrong ones takes long
enough. Calculating how many dollars per calorie per day your pet
consumes can vary wildly from one diet to the next, and is critical
in budgeting how many dollars go towards Coco and Felix.

Pet Food Shopper is here to simplify this process, removing the need
for a spreadsheet to effectively price shop pet diets. In addition,
you won't need a pet nutritionist to know what that pet food label
is really telling you.
